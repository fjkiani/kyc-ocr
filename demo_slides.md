# Document Processing Demo: Traditional OCR vs Document Inlining
## Banking Institution Loan Processing Solution

---

## Agenda

1. Recap of Your Document Challenges (5 min)
2. Current Architecture & Exploration (8 min)
3. Document Inlining Solution (10 min)
4. Live Demo with Your Documents (15 min)
5. Integration & Security Path (5 min)
6. Q&A and Next Steps (2 min)

---

## Your Current Document Processing Challenges

- **OCR Accuracy Issues**: 5-10% of fields missing or incorrect
- **Manual Verification Bottlenecks**: Loan officers reviewing documents, causing backlog
- **Processing Delays**: 1-2 day correction cycles with customers
- **Scaling Problems**: System slows down with increased volume
- **Limited AI Exploration**: Testing GPT-4 but facing structural preservation issues

*"Our team is primarily focused on loans, not technology. We need a solution that's easy to integrate but powerful enough to handle complex documents."*

## What is Compound AI? Simplified for Banking

Compound AI combines multiple AI capabilities to handle complex banking documents:

1. **Document Structure Analysis**: Preserves relationships in tables, forms, and multi-page documents

2. **Financial Domain Knowledge**: Specialized understanding of banking terminology and document types

3. **Validation & Cross-Checking**: Automatically verifies extracted information for accuracy

Think of it like having a team of specialized loan processors working together, but fully automated:
- One preserving document structure (tables, forms)
- One extracting the relevant banking information
- One validating the extracted data for accuracy

*No specialized technical knowledge required to implement — designed for loan processing teams*

| Manual data extraction | Focus on decision-making |
| Routine verification | Exception handling only |
| Document classification | Strategic risk assessment |
| Error correction | Process improvement |
| Customer follow-up for errors | Higher-value customer service |

*Your team's expertise is directed to where it adds the most value, not routine tasks*

---

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Pilot (4-6 Weeks)
- Select 1-2 document types (bank statements, loan applications)
- Define verification thresholds and routing rules
- Train verification team on new workflow
- Measure baseline vs. new process metrics

### Phase 2: Expansion (2-3 Months)
- Add remaining document types
- Refine confidence thresholds based on pilot results
- Integrate with downstream systems
- Optimize human verification workflow

### Phase 3: Full Implementation (3-4 Months)
- Complete integration with all banking systems
- Implement advanced analytics and monitoring
- Optimize verification criteria
- Scale to full production volume

*We'll partner with you through each phase, with clear success metrics*

## Live Demo: Bank Statement Processing

We'll process an actual bank statement using all three approaches:

1. **Traditional OCR approach**
   - Show the 5-10% error rate in action
   - Demonstrate table structure loss
   - Highlight manual verification requirements

2. **Current GPT-4 testing**
   - Show your current sandbox approach
   - Highlight structural preservation issues
   - Demonstrate scaling limitations
   
3. **Document Inlining approach**
   - Show complete table structure preservation
   - Demonstrate >98% accuracy with the same document
   - Highlight processing time difference

Understanding Document Inlining Technology
Based on the information provided, let me explore Document Inlining technology in more depth to help you better explain it during your discovery meeting.
Core Concept of Document Inlining
Document Inlining is a compound AI technology developed by Fireworks AI that solves a fundamental challenge in AI document processing: bridging the "modality gap" between document formats (images, PDFs) and language models. It works by:
Transforming Documents: Converting images and PDFs into formats that language models can process effectively
Preserving Structure: Maintaining the structural integrity of documents, including tables, charts, and layouts
Enabling Better Reasoning: Allowing specialized text-based language models to reason about document content
The Modality Gap Problem
The term "modality gap" refers to a key insight: vision models (VLMs) typically perform worse on reasoning tasks compared to text-only language models, even when working with identical information. This happens because:
Vision models are optimized for visual understanding but often have less sophisticated reasoning capabilities
Text models receive more extensive training for reasoning and instruction-following
Working across modalities (from visual to reasoning) creates inefficiencies in how information is processed
Technical Implementation
Document Inlining uses a two-step approach:
Parsing Phase:
Transcribes non-textual content using "complete OCR" technology
Detects and properly formats tables, charts, and other structured elements
Maintains document hierarchy and relationships between elements
Preserves the structural information that gives context to the content
Ingestion Phase:
Feeds the resulting structured text into a specialized language model
Enables reasoning and analysis using more powerful text-based models
Allows for using domain-specific or fine-tuned models that wouldn't otherwise handle images
Technical Integration
The implementation is remarkably simple:
Uses an OpenAI-compatible API for easier adoption
Requires just adding #transform=inline to the file reference in the API call
Example: "url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/fireworks-public/test/sample_resume.pdf#transform=inline"
Works with both images and multi-page PDFs
Proven Performance
In internal benchmarks comparing Document Inlining with standard vision models:
The approach outperformed GPT-4o on document processing tasks in 68% of tests
Tests were conducted on 100 article-question pairs from arXiv documents
Evaluation was done by Claude 3.5-Sonnet to ensure objectivity
Advantages for Loan Processing Applications
For financial services loan processing, Document Inlining offers specific advantages:
Complex Document Handling: Loan applications involve many document types with complex structures (W2s, bank statements, loan applications, etc.)
Accuracy Improvements: Better reasoning leads to more accurate extraction of critical financial data points
Table Processing: Financial documents often contain tables with critical numerical data (income statements, amortization schedules, etc.)
Cross-Document Verification: Can better understand relationships between information across multiple documents in a loan package
Specialized Models: Allows using financial domain-specific language models that wouldn't normally process images
Efficiency: Parallel processing of multi-page documents improves throughput for high-volume loan processing
How It's Different from Traditional Approaches
Traditional approaches typically involve:
Using OCR to extract text from documents
Creating multiple processing pipelines for different document types
Building custom extractors for tables and structured data
Manually stitching extracted information together
Document Inlining eliminates these complex steps by:
Handling the transformation automatically
Preserving document structure during transformation
Using the reasoning capabilities of text models to understand context
Requiring minimal code changes to implement
Visualization for Your Architecture Diagram
To make your Mermaid diagram more accurate, you might consider:
Adding a "Structure Preservation" component that shows how tables, charts, and hierarchies are maintained
Illustrating the parallel processing of multi-page documents
Showing how the technology enables specialized financial models to process document content
Depicting the comparison between traditional vision model processing and the Document Inlining approach
