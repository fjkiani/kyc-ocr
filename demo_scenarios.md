# Demo Scenarios for Financial Services Follow-up Meeting

## Overview
This document outlines potential demo scenarios to showcase Fireworks AI capabilities for loan processing automation. These scenarios should be customized based on the specific pain points identified during the initial discovery meeting.

## Scenario 1: Automated Document Processing Pipeline

**Challenge Addressed:** Manual document review and data extraction

**Demo Flow:**
1. Show a typical loan application package (mortgage application, W2s, bank statements, etc.)
2. Demonstrate automated document classification (identifying document types without manual sorting)
3. Show intelligent data extraction from multiple document formats:
   - Digitally created PDFs
   - Scanned documents
   - Photographed documents with varying quality
4. Highlight cross-document validation (matching borrower information across multiple documents)
5. Demonstrate exception handling for low-confidence extractions
6. Show the complete extracted dataset ready for integration with loan origination system

**Key Metrics to Highlight:**
- Processing time reduced from 2-3 hours to 5-10 minutes per application
- 95%+ extraction accuracy across all document types
- 90% reduction in manual data entry requirements

## Scenario 2: Compliance Automation

**Challenge Addressed:** Manual compliance checks and regulatory burden

**Demo Flow:**
1. Demonstrate automated regulatory checks against required guidelines:
   - TRID (TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure)
   - Fair lending requirements
   - QM (Qualified Mortgage) standards
2. Show how the system identifies potential compliance issues:
   - Missing required disclosures
   - Inconsistent information across documents
   - Potential fair lending violations
3. Demonstrate the complete audit trail generation:
   - Which documents were processed
   - What data was extracted
   - What verifications were performed
   - Explanations for decisions made
4. Show compliance dashboards and reporting capabilities

**Key Metrics to Highlight:**
- 100% audit coverage (vs. typical sample-based audits)
- 85% reduction in compliance review time
- Significantly reduced regulatory risk exposure

## Scenario 3: Intelligent Workflow Automation

**Challenge Addressed:** Inefficient routing and processing bottlenecks

**Demo Flow:**
1. Show a queue of incoming loan applications
2. Demonstrate intelligent prioritization and routing:
   - By loan type (conventional, FHA, VA)
   - By completeness of documentation
   - By risk factors identified
3. Show how the system identifies missing documents or information
4. Demonstrate automated customer communication for missing items
5. Show real-time status tracking and bottleneck identification
6. Demonstrate integration with existing loan origination system

**Key Metrics to Highlight:**
- 40% reduction in overall processing time
- 70% decrease in application status inquiries
- Increased capacity without additional staffing

## Scenario 4: Risk Assessment Enhancement

**Challenge Addressed:** Inconsistent underwriting and risk evaluation

**Demo Flow:**
1. Show how the system analyzes applicant financial data across multiple documents
2. Demonstrate automated verification against external data sources:
   - Employment verification
   - Income verification
   - Property valuation
3. Show risk factor identification and scoring
4. Demonstrate how the system provides consistent underwriting recommendations
5. Show explainability features that justify each recommendation

**Key Metrics to Highlight:**
- 30% reduction in underwriting time
- 25% decrease in loan defaults due to better risk assessment
- Consistent application of underwriting criteria

## Customization Notes

Before the demo meeting:
1. Determine which 2-3 scenarios align most closely with their specific challenges
2. Prepare demo data that resembles their actual loan documents (anonymized)
3. Adjust terminology to match their internal language
4. Prepare ROI calculations specific to their processing volume
5. Identify integration points with their existing systems

## Technical Requirements

For the live demo:
- Test the demo with realistic document samples beforehand
- Ensure connectivity to Fireworks AI platform
- Prepare fallback recordings in case of connectivity issues
- Have example API documentation ready to show integration approach
