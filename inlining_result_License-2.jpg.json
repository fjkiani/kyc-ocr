      "value": "### Document Structure Analysis\n\nThe provided document appears to be a representation of a Pennsylvania driver's license, with various sections containing personal and license information. The structure includes headings, paragraphs, and what seems to be a table or list format for presenting detailed information about the license holder.\n\n### Extracted Information\n\n1. **Header Information**\n   - **State**: Pennsylvania\n   - **Website**: visitPA.com\n   - **Country**: USA\n\n2. **License Information**\n   - **Type**: NOT FOR REAL ID\n   - **Purpose**: Not specified beyond \"PURPOSES\"\n\n3. **License Details**\n   - **DLN (Driver's License Number)**: 99 999 999\n   - **DOB (Date of Birth)**: 01/07/2005\n   - **EXP (Expiration Date)**: 01/08/2026\n   - **ISS (Issue Date)**: 01/07/2022\n   - **CLASS**: C\n   - **END (Endorsements)**: NONE\n   - **RESTR (Restrictions)**: NONE\n\n4. **Age Restrictions**\n   - **Under 21 Until**: 01/07/2026\n   - **Under 18 Until**: 01/07/2023\n\n5. **Name**\n   - **Full Name**: Janice Sample\n   - **Last Name**: SAMPLE\n   - **First Name**: JANICE ANN\n\n6. **Address**\n   - **Street**: 123 MAIN STREET\n   - **Apt**: 1\n   - **City**: HARRISBURG\n   - **State**: PA\n   - **Zip**: 17101-0000\n\n7. **Personal Details**\n   - **Sex**: F\n   - **Height**: 5'-05\"\n   - **Eyes**: BLU\n   - **DUPS**: 00\n\n8. **Additional License Information**\n   - **DD (Document Discriminator)**: 1234567890123\n   - **Additional Number**: 456789012345\n\n### Tables and Form Fields\n\nWhile there are no traditional tables, the information is presented in a structured format that resembles form fields or a list. Each piece of information is labeled (e.g., \"4d DLN:\", \"3 DOB:\", etc.), suggesting a form-like structure where each label corresponds to a specific field.\n\n### Relationships Between Elements\n\n- The document is divided into sections by horizontal lines (`<hr>`), separating different types of information (license details, age restrictions, personal details, etc.).\n- Each section contains related information. For example, all details about the license (number, expiration, issue date) are grouped together.\n- The use of numbers and letters (e.g., \"4d DLN:\", \"3 DOB:\") suggests a coding system where each number and letter combination refers to a specific field or piece of information on the license.\n\n### Overall Confidence Score\n\nGiven the structured nature of the document and the clear labeling of each piece of information, the confidence in the extraction of this data is high. However, without additional context or a reference to the exact format specifications of a Pennsylvania driver's license, there might be minor uncertainties in the interpretation of certain fields (e.g., \"DUPS: 00\"). Therefore, the overall confidence score is **0.95**. This reflects a high degree of accuracy in extracting the provided information but acknowledges the potential for slight discrepancies in field interpretation without further context.",
