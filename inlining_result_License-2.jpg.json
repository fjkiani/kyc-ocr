Nonetheless, the majority of the information is straightforward and clearly extractable.\n\n**Confidence Score: 0.95**\n\nThis score reflects a high degree of confidence in the extraction process, with minimal ambiguity in interpreting the provided fields. The slight reduction from a perfect score accounts for any potential nuances in field interpretations that might arise without additional context.",
