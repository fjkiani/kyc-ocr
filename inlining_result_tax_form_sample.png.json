The information extracted is personal and related to the identification and physical characteristics of the individual.\n- There are no tables or form fields in the traditional sense, but rather a structured format of paragraphs that contain specific pieces of information.\n- The relationships between elements are primarily sequential, with each section of the document providing different types of information about the individual.\n\n### Confidence Score\nGiven the straightforward nature of the document and the clear structure of the information presented, I would assign a confidence score of **0.9** for the extraction. The only element that reduces the confidence score is the \"DD\" field, which is not clearly defined and contains what appears to be placeholder or corrupted data. Otherwise, the extraction of information from the provided document is relatively straightforward and unambiguous.",
