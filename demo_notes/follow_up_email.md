## Subject: Thank You and Next Steps Following Our Document Processing Discussion

Dear [Name],

Thank you for taking the time yesterday to discuss the loan processing challenges your team is facing. I found our conversation extremely valuable in understanding the specific OCR accuracy issues, document processing bottlenecks, and scalability concerns your institution is experiencing.

## Key Points from Our Discussion

Based on our conversation, I understand your primary challenges include:

* **OCR Accuracy Issues**: Your current OCR solutions struggle with complex financial documents, particularly tables and multi-page relationships, requiring significant manual verification.

* **Manual Processing Bottlenecks**: The need for human review creates delays that impact customer satisfaction and operational efficiency, especially during peak seasons.

* **Document Structure Preservation**: Information relationships in complex documents are being lost, affecting downstream processes and decision-making.

* **Exploratory AI Initiatives**: You're in the early stages of exploring Gen AI solutions like GPT but haven't found a comprehensive approach that addresses structure preservation.

## Brief Overview of Fireworks AI and Document Inlining

I realize I didn't fully explain what makes Fireworks AI's approach unique, so I wanted to provide a brief overview:

Traditional document AI systems (including standard OCR and even vision-based LLMs like GPT-4V) treat documents as images, which creates what we call a "modality gap." This gap is where complex structures like tables, form relationships, and multi-page connections get lost during processing.

Our Document Inlining technology takes a fundamentally different approach:

1. Instead of treating documents as images, we transform them into formats that preserve their structure and relationships
2. This transformation enables specialized language models to process documents with their full reasoning capabilities intact
3. The result is significantly higher accuracy (95%+) on complex financial documents and dramatically faster processing (85% reduction in processing time)

In practical terms, this means your loan documents can be processed with:
* Tables that maintain their structure and relationships between columns/rows
* Form fields that preserve their intended context
* Multi-page documents that maintain connections across pages
* Financial calculations that are properly understood in context

This directly addresses the OCR accuracy issues and manual verification requirements you described in our discussion.

## Next Steps for the Demo

As discussed, we'll prepare a demonstration of Fireworks AI's Document Inlining technology for our next meeting. To ensure the demo addresses your specific needs, could you provide some additional information:

1. **Timeline Considerations**: What is your target timeline for implementing a solution? Are there any upcoming milestones, peak seasons, or business initiatives that would influence this timeline?

2. **Sample Documents**: Would you be able to share (redacted) samples of 2-3 document types that create the most significant challenges? This would allow us to tailor our demo to your exact use cases.

3. **Current Metrics**: Do you have approximate figures for your current document processing times, error rates, or manual review requirements? This would help us quantify the potential improvement.

4. **Compliance Requirements**: Are there specific regulatory or compliance frameworks we should address in our security and compliance discussion?

5. **Technical Environment**: Could you share any constraints or requirements regarding integration with your existing loan processing system?

## Proposed Agenda for Next Meeting

For our next session, we propose the following agenda:

1. Demonstration of Document Inlining with side-by-side comparison to traditional OCR approaches
2. Integration approach and technical requirements
3. Security and compliance considerations
4. Expected ROI and implementation timeline
5. Q&A with product team member

Please let me know if you'd like to adjust this agenda or add specific topics.

I'm also happy to schedule a brief call before our next meeting if you have any questions or would like to discuss any aspect of the proposed solution in more detail.

Thank you again for your time. I look forward to showing you how Fireworks AI can address your document processing challenges.
